this project is the first react project by me (ALEX KIOCHUKOV).
this demonstrates my css skills,ability to include 3rd party extensions, and logic with nav/redux and context.
the website logo was taken and altered with photoshop aswell the login photo.
i have learned so much during this project and i owe my thanks to my parents friends that helped along the way and most importantly 
i owe my thanks to my course teacher Tomer Buzaglo for incredible teaching method of perfectly multi tasking and still being able to 
be coherent  with examples and explanation. 
this is only the start from here i will continue to learn and expand my knowledge and understanding of code.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING!.
